## Introduction

This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step techniques for solving mathematical problems in Algebra and Further Mathematics. Whether you're preparing for exams or looking to strengthen your problem-solving skills, this guide offers structured approaches to tackle various mathematical challenges.

## Algebraic Equations

### Linear Equations

#### Step-by-Step Approach:
1. **Identify the equation type**: Recognize if it's a linear equation (degree 1)
2. **Isolate the variable**: Move all terms with the variable to one side
3. **Simplify**: Combine like terms
4. **Solve**: Divide by the coefficient of the variable
5. **Check**: Substitute back into the original equation

#### Example 1: Simple Linear Equation
**Problem**: Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: 3x + 7 = 22
Step 2: 3x = 22 - 7    (subtract 7 from both sides)
Step 3: 3x = 15        (simplify)
Step 4: x = 15/3       (divide by 3)
Step 5: x = 5

Check: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 ✓
```

#### Example 2: Linear Equation with Fractions
**Problem**: Solve for x: (2x - 1)/3 = (x + 4)/2

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: (2x - 1)/3 = (x + 4)/2
Step 2: 2(2x - 1) = 3(x + 4)    (cross multiply)
Step 3: 4x - 2 = 3x + 12        (expand)
Step 4: 4x - 3x = 12 + 2        (collect like terms)
Step 5: x = 14

Check: (2(14) - 1)/3 = 27/3 = 9, (14 + 4)/2 = 18/2 = 9 ✓
```

### Quadratic Equations

#### Methods for Solving:
1. **Factoring**
2. **Quadratic Formula**
3. **Completing the Square**

#### Example 1: Factoring Method
**Problem**: Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: x² + 5x + 6 = 0
Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5: 2 and 3
Step 3: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
Step 4: x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0
Step 5: x = -2 or x = -3
```

#### Example 2: Quadratic Formula
**Problem**: Solve 2x² - 3x - 2 = 0

**Solution**:
```
Using x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a where a = 2, b = -3, c = -2

Step 1: x = (3 ± √(9 - 4(2)(-2))) / 4
Step 2: x = (3 ± √(9 + 16)) / 4
Step 3: x = (3 ± √25) / 4
Step 4: x = (3 ± 5) / 4
Step 5: x = 8/4 = 2 or x = -2/4 = -0.5
```

### Systems of Equations

#### Substitution Method
**Problem**: Solve the system:
- x + y = 8
- 2x - y = 1

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: From equation 1: y = 8 - x
Step 2: Substitute into equation 2: 2x - (8 - x) = 1
Step 3: 2x - 8 + x = 1
Step 4: 3x = 9
Step 5: x = 3
Step 6: y = 8 - 3 = 5

Solution: (3, 5)
```

## Word Problems

### General Strategy for Word Problems

1. **Read carefully**: Understand what's being asked
2. **Identify variables**: Define what you're solving for
3. **Translate**: Convert words into mathematical expressions
4. **Set up equations**: Based on the relationships described
5. **Solve**: Use algebraic methods
6. **Check**: Verify the answer makes sense in context

### Common Word Problem Types

#### Age Problems
**Problem**: John is 3 times as old as Mary. In 10 years, John will be twice as old as Mary. How old are they now?

**Solution**:
```
Let M = Mary's current age, J = John's current age

Step 1: Set up equations from the problem:
   - J = 3M (John is 3 times as old as Mary)
   - J + 10 = 2(M + 10) (In 10 years, John will be twice as old as Mary)

Step 2: Substitute J = 3M into the second equation:
   3M + 10 = 2(M + 10)
   3M + 10 = 2M + 20
   M = 10

Step 3: Find John's age:
   J = 3(10) = 30

Answer: Mary is 10 years old, John is 30 years old
```

#### Distance/Rate/Time Problems
**Problem**: A car travels 240 miles in the same time it takes a truck to travel 180 miles. If the car travels 20 mph faster than the truck, find their speeds.

**Solution**:
```
Let t = truck's speed, c = car's speed = t + 20

Using Distance = Rate × Time, so Time = Distance/Rate

Step 1: Set up equation (same time for both):
   240/c = 180/t
   240/(t + 20) = 180/t

Step 2: Cross multiply:
   240t = 180(t + 20)
   240t = 180t + 3600
   60t = 3600
   t = 60 mph

Step 3: Find car's speed:
   c = 60 + 20 = 80 mph

Answer: Truck: 60 mph, Car: 80 mph
```

## Advanced Topics

### Polynomial Functions

#### Factoring Polynomials
- **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**
- **Difference of squares**: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)
- **Perfect square trinomials**: a² ± 2ab + b² = (a ± b)²

#### Example: Factor 4x³ - 16x
**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Find GCF: 4x(x² - 4)
Step 2: Recognize difference of squares: x² - 4 = x² - 2²
Step 3: Factor: 4x(x + 2)(x - 2)
```

### Rational Functions

#### Simplifying Rational Expressions
**Problem**: Simplify (x² - 9)/(x² + 6x + 9)

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Factor numerator: x² - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)
Step 2: Factor denominator: x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²
Step 3: Simplify: (x + 3)(x - 3)/(x + 3)² = (x - 3)/(x + 3)
```

### Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

#### Solving Exponential Equations
**Problem**: Solve 2^(x+1) = 32

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Express 32 as a power of 2: 32 = 2⁵
Step 2: 2^(x+1) = 2⁵
Step 3: Since bases are equal: x + 1 = 5
Step 4: x = 4
```

#### Solving Logarithmic Equations
**Problem**: Solve log₂(x) + log₂(x - 3) = 2

**Solution**:
```
Step 1: Use logarithm property: log₂(x(x - 3)) = 2
Step 2: Convert to exponential form: x(x - 3) = 2²
Step 3: x² - 3x = 4
Step 4: x² - 3x - 4 = 0
Step 5: Factor: (x - 4)(x + 1) = 0
Step 6: x = 4 or x = -1

Check: x = -1 gives log₂(-1), which is undefined
Therefore: x = 4
```
